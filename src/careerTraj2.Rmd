age gradient
In that paper, results of races from 1991 to 1999, a period of constant points allocation in which the top 6 places received points, were used.




when doing team model need to bear in mmind the caveat about the team affiliation being last round. 
also requirement that driver was competing in last round of season




```{r}
drivers2013=dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE driverId IN (SELECT DISTINCT ds.driverId from driverStandings ds JOIN races r WHERE r.year=2013 AND r.raceId=ds.raceId )')
```

Find the standings at the end of a particular year - 

```{r}
drivers2013=dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'SELECT d.driverRef, d.code, ds.position, d.dob FROM driverStandings ds JOIN drivers d WHERE ds.raceID IN (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE year=2013 and round IN (SELECT MAX(round) FROM races WHERE year=2013)) AND ds.driverId=d.driverId')

drivers2013$dob=as.Date(drivers2013$dob)
drivers2013$birthyear=format(drivers2013$dob, "%Y")
```

The age-productivity gradient: evidence from a sample of F1 drivers

??how about doing all races and age as 


Get drivers in 2013

Get last races of year

Get standings of drivers in 2013 in all last races of year

Get all their standins in last 



FInd last races over all years 

dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW lastRounds AS SELECT s.year,r.raceId,r.round,r.name, s.maxRound FROM (SELECT year,MAX(round) maxRound FROM races GROUP BY year) s JOIN races r WHERE r.round=s.maxRound AND r.year=s.year')

dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'SELECT * from lastRounds LIMIT 10')



tmp=dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'SELECT * from driverStandings ds JOIN races r JOIN drivers d WHERE ds.raceId in (SELECT raceId FROM lastRounds) AND ds.driverId IN (SELECT driverId FROM drivers2013) AND r.raceId=ds.raceId AND d.driverId=ds.driverId')

tmp2=dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'SELECT * from constructorStandings cs JOIN races r JOIN constructors c WHERE cs.raceId in (SELECT raceId FROM lastRounds) AND cs.constructorId IN (SELECT constructorId FROM constructors2013) AND r.raceId=cs.raceId AND c.constructorId=cs.constructorId')

drivers with at least 10 years history

dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'SELECT d.driverId, d.driverRef, COUNT(*) years FROM driverStandings ds JOIN drivers d WHERE raceId IN (SELECT raceId FROM lastRounds) AND d.driverId=ds.driverId GROUP BY ds.driverId HAVING years>=10 ORDER BY years DESC')

Can also do chamionships by constructor?

dbGetQuery(con_ergastdb, 'SELECT c.constructorId, c.constructorRef, COUNT(*) years FROM constructorStandings cs JOIN constructors c WHERE raceId IN (SELECT raceId FROM lastRounds) AND c.constructorId=cs.constructorId GROUP BY cs.constructorId HAVING years>=10 ORDER BY years DESC')

??any dbpedia data for teams previously known as?
