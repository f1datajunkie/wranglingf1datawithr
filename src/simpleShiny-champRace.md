A Simple Shiny Explorer - The Race to the Championship
========================================================

With the final two rounds of the 2012 Championship, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso were separated by just 10 points, with third placed Kimi Raikkonen over 50 points behind Vettel, and therefore out of the running for the driver's World Champion position.

There are essentially two steps (with an optional middle third step) to a Shiny model:

- a file (*ui.R*) containing  
- a file (*server.R*) containing
- an optional file (*global.R*) 





work out the points difference between VET and ALO for all their possible points combinations in the US Grand Prix;
calculate the points difference going into the Brazilian Grand Prix;
calculate the possible outcomes depending on placements in the Brazilian Grand Prix (essentially, an application of the algorithm I did in the original post).
The Shiny app requires two bits of code â€“ a UI in file ui.R, in which I define two sliders that allow me to set the actual (or anticpated, or possible;-) race classifications in the US for Vettel and Alonso:

for i in range(len(points)):
    #Build up each row - start with VET's classification
    row=[str(i+1)]
    #Now for the columns - that is, ALO's classification
    for j in range(len(points)):
        #Work out the points if VET is placed i+1  and ALO at j+1 (i and j start at 0)
        #Find the difference between the points scores
        #If the difference is >= 25 (the biggest points diff ALO could achieve in Brazil), VET wins
