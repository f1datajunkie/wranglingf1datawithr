# Laptime Processing

For the F1 data fan, laptimes are the one of the richest sources of data available to use, though this remains a far cry from the data that is available to the teams the themselves, and is not even as rich as the timing screen data that is to streamed to purchasers of the F1 app.

Charts such as the race history chart and the battlemap charts are based on laptime data, as are leader lap count calculations.

Laptimes - not just by lapcount, but also on-track, eg when car has been lapped and lapcounts are out of synch
