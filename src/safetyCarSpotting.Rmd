In .. we saw how it was possible to neutralise the effect of a safety car on the race history chart. So how might we automatically identify when the race has entered a safety car period?

One way would be to make use of the *streakiness* tools to identify runs of laptimes across the whole field that are significantly slower than the typical laptimes.
