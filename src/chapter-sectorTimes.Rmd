# A Closer Look at Sector Times

*In several previous chapters, we have already touched on how we can start to look at sector times. In this chapter, we shall look rather more comprehensively at this class of timing information. Whilst this may incur some amount of repetition, we will also extend the several of the techniques introduced previously.*

As well as complete laptimes - the time it takes a car to complete a single lap of a circuit - motor racing circuits are often split into one or more *sectors*.

Start trying to categorise circuits?
eg make use of Brembo data?
