#Chapter - How Do Session Positions Relate to Each other?


As well as coming up with our own questions and analyses, it's also possible to find inspiration from the work of others. The approach I will take in this chapter, as well as in several others, is to try to replicate the work of others using R scripts based on formulas and analyses published elsewhere.

The 2010 paper [*A tale of two motorsports: A graphical-statistical analysis of how practice, qualifying, and past success relate to finish position in NASCAR and Formula One racing*] (http://newton.uor.edu/FacultyFolder/Silva/NASCARvF1.pdf) by Kathleen and Francisco Silva "examine[s] the relationships between drivers' finish positions and their performances during the final practice, qualifying, and past races." Although the original paper compares models for both NASCAR and Formula One, I'll just be focussing on the F1 data here. (If you can can the data into a similar format, there's no reason why the analysis shouldn't also work on NASCAR data.)
