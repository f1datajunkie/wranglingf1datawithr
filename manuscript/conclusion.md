# Conclusion

*This book is currently a work in progress, with many chapters containing elements that are still in note and draft form.*

Data is everywhere. *Looking* at data, whether through simple summary statistics, data visualisations, or via complex predictive models, provides us with opportunities for telling stories about the world that might otherwise be missed.

I am well aware that this book may well fall short in the stories it tells - that's part of the problem of being a data junkie (working the data and working with the data becomes an end in itself; the processes by which the story can be found are the fix, the actual stories are for others to find...). But that in part arises from the aim that this book provides some utility as a manual in describing techniques for using R (and let's not forget SQL), and working with data, more generally, whatever the dataset.

There are three levels of success, I think, for the various techniques and strategies described in this book as they particularly relate to Formula One and motorsport in particular, and other sports in general:

  1. They get adopted by teams and drivers for tracking and helping to improve performance.
  2. They are used by the media and PR teams for reporting and explaining motorsport news and have a role to play in motorsport features.
  3. They provide grist to the mill for F1 stats fans.

But if nothing else, I hope that this book will inspire *you* to have conversations with the data that will reveal far more compelling stories about this fast paced technological sport that inspires many of us with it's short lead times and constant innovation.
