#Appendix One - Scraping formula1.com Timing Data

The formula1.com website publishes current season and historical results data dating back to 1950 at [http://www.formula1.com/results/](http://www.formula1.com/results/).  From 1950 to 2002 only race results are provided. Since 2003, the data includes results from practice and qualifying sessions. From 2004, best sector times and speed trap data is also available for practice and qualifying sessions, and fastest laps and pit stop information for the race.

The scraper has been written to allow you to scrape data for individual sessions and years. If you use it, please use it responsibly...

If you have any problems running the script, or find any errors or issues with the scraped data, such as bogus or incorrectly formatted data in the data tables, please post an issue to [F1 results scraper issues](https://github.com/psychemedia/wranglingf1datawithr/issues).
