# Conclusion

Data is everywhere. *Looking* at data, whether through simple summary statistics, data visualisations, or via complex predictive models, provides us with opportunities for telling stories about the world that might otherwise be missed.

In this book we have looked at a wide range of techniques for wrangling, and visualising, F1 related datasets.

I am well aware that this book may well fall short in terms of the actual stories it tells about particular races, championships or career histories, or how to read stories, in detail, from some of the charts shown. Many of the sections would benefit from detailed examples of how to actually read the charts. However, I have tried to structure the data wrangling elements in terms of how to structure data and charts in order to answer particular questions or tease out particular insights. The stories themselves come from learning how to read the colours, shapes and positioning of the marks on the page, and starting to recognise particular patterns within them that reveal particular sorts or story or story feature.

Now that the code is in place, this project has an opportunity to move on, deploying the tools and techniques developed in these pages in the analysis of F1 races and championships on a race by race basis. The [f1datajunkie](http://www.f1datajunkie.com/) blog will be the home to my own explorations in this area.

There are three levels of wider success, or *impact*, I think, for the various techniques and strategies described in this book as they particularly relate to Formula One and motorsport in particular, and other sports in general:

  1. They get adopted by teams and drivers for tracking and helping to improve performance, which I fear is unlikely - I'm sure the teams have many more tried and tested tools and techniques at their disposal.
  2. They are used by the media and PR teams for reporting and explaining motorsport news and help contribute to the discovery and telling and of motorsport stories.
  3. They provide grist to the mill for F1 stats fans looking for things to do with the data.

If nothing else, I hope that this book has inspired *you* to start having conversations with the data, conversations that will reveal compelling stories about this fast paced technological sport, that inspires many of us with its short lead times and constant innovation. Whether by learning to read the charts developed in these pages, or using the techniques or ideas contained herein as a springboard to creating your own analytical tools, I hope you have fun with the data!

*This book started off it's published life as a public work in progress on [Leanpub.com](http://leanpub.com), with many chapters containing elements that were originaly presented in note or draft form. As such, the structure and organisation of the book took on a life of its own and may yet continue to evolve.*
